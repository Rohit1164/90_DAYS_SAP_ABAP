Ready-to-Speak Answer (Professional)

I worked on a MATMAS IDOC mini project where material master data was transferred from one SAP system to another using ALE/IDOC technology.

In this project, whenever a material was created or changed in the source system, an outbound MATMAS IDOC was generated using change pointers. I configured the partner profile, port, message type, and IDOC type.

The IDOC was sent via RFC to the receiving system, where it was processed using an inbound function module to create or update the material master.

I monitored IDOCs using WE02 and handled errors with status 51 by analyzing segments and reprocessing the IDOC. This project helped me understand real-time data integration between SAP systems.
